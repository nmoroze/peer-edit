# Peer-Edit (Archived)

Revisely / Peer-Edit is a project by @nmoroze and @themichaelyang that allows users to give and recieve feedback on writing. 
It features a point based system to incentivize editing -- users can place bounties for feedback, and reward the best edits.
These points can then be used to place bounties on their own writing.

It was built for the Stanford Startup Engineering MOOC on Coursera (2013).
